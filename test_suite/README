RUN_TEST_SUITE runs the tests in each directory using the source in 
 the directory above (../conman)

CLEAN_TEST_SUITE deletes the output programs (should be unnnecessary but safe)

make_table.bash - reads the output and create a latex file (blankenbach.tex), 
 then compile it and creates a postscript file: blankenbach.ps  You may need to edit
 the locations of latex and dvips.
